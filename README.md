A simple m3u8 video player site mainly built to see cnbc-live-tv from another simple place(as all the other promotion shit is useless for my dad and for all others too)
& most browsers dont support m3u8 so the file will be downloaded instead of viewing it (and my dad uses it in popup in opera and incase he uses external media player it results in more memory consumption thats why this is is here 😐💀😏🦹‍♂️)

## Guide to use this:
1. Extract the video url from the site
2. Replace the video url in HTML
3. If u want to modify the design of the media player checkout https://docs.videojs.com for customizing it
